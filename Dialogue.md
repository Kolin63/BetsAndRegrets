0.0 You've lived a **bad** life, and now you're in the afterlife.
    You want a second chance, so you made a deal with the *devil*.
    You need to get 10 million dollars. You can get it by working for ***hundreds of years***, or you could gamble it all for a chance to win **BIG**.
    Luckily, you have *$5.32* from your wallet when you died. That's more than enough to gamble! 
    And besides, most gamblers quit before they win big, so naturally, you won't quit, right? But be careful when you're gambling! 
    If you lose too much, you'll be the devil's indentured servant...

6.2 Narrator: After the man was let free, he lived life to the best of his ability. He became a loving husband and a caring father. He volunteered at his local soup kitchen, and was a good person overall. He had stopped lying and cheating his way through life. He was no longer, his own worst enemy. (After he wins)
7.0 Narrator: After the man was imprisoned, his body laid lifeless. He hadn't learned his lesson about being his own worst enemy. He served the devil for the rest of eternity. (After he loses)

4.0 Devil: Back again? You really wanna be my servant, don't you? (When he loses his seconds soul, he snaps, screen flashes white and fades back to game as transition for all soul losses)
6.0 Devil: Grr... You've won.. I'm a man of my word, you are free... (when you win the game)
5.0 Devil: Hahahaha! You've only got one shot left, after this, you'll be mine forever. *snap* (After he loses his third soul)
