# Bets and Regrets
***
You've lived a **bad** life, and now you're in the afterlife. You want a second chance, so you made a deal with the *devil*. You need to get 10 million dollars. You can get it by working for ***hundreds of years***, or you could gamble it all for a chance to win **BIG**. Luckily, you have *$5.32* from your wallet when you died. That's more than enough to gamble! And besides, most gamblers quit before they win big, so naturally, you won't quit, right? But be careful when you're gambling! If you lose too much, you'll need to pay off your debt with a portion of your soul, but if you don't have a **soul** anymore, you become the devil's servant.

## Rules
Every day, you can play Plinko once to try and get some money, just drop a ball or two and see where it leads you! Each ball will cost you a dollar, so use them wisely! [INSERT IMAGES WITH DESCRIPTIONS HERE]

- I guess it's something (when he wins a day, has max souls, earnings are above 2x exclusive)
- This game is rigged! (after he loses 3 times in a row, he has max souls)
- %*$@! (When he loses and no other conditions are met, max souls)
- How am I supposed to get **10 MILLION** DOLLARS?
- C'mon lucky 7! (When you use 7 balls)

- Devil: You ran out of money, game's over buddy... (When you lose the soul for the 1st time)
- N-no, please give me another chance. I... I'll give you a fourth of my soul, just please, give me another chance! (When you lose your first soul)
- Devil: Alright, fine, but when your soul becomes mine, **you** become mine. Hahahaha... (After you offer your soul)
- At least I'm not back where I started... (after he loses his first soul)
- Devil: Back again? You really wanna be my servant, don't you? (When he loses his seconds soul, he snaps, screen flashes white and fades back to game as transition for all soul losses)
- I've really got to start being more careful with this... (After he loses his second soul)
- I miss my family... (After he loses a day after losing 2 souls)
-  Hahahaha! You've only got one shot left, after this, you'll be mine forever. *snap* (After he loses his third soul)
- *shakey voice* N-no... I've really got to be more careful. I need to get back to my family (after he loses his third soul)
- *gasp* YES, YES! I HAVE A CHANCE (when he wins a day after losing 3 souls)
